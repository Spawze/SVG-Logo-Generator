This project requires NodeJs in order to run, since it is a console program. After Node is installed, download the project to your computer and navigate to the directory in a console. Use the command 'npm install' to install the dependencies, then run 'node index.js' to get started. Once you have answered all the prompts, navigate to the ouptut folder in the directory, and logo.svg will be there.
